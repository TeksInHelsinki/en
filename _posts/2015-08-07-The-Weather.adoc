Finland, as everybody - hopefully - knows, is really cold! +
I'm gonna talk about how cold it really is and what you can do to prepare yourself consequently.
 
=== The Temperatures

I did not find any precise sources concerning the temperatures, but I'm gonna try anyway.

Basically it almost never really goes around -30°C in Helsinki, but -10°C happens. It's rarely above 0°C during winter. +
In the North, especially once you're in Lapland, it's obviously colder. So -30°C can happen... and maybe even less.

About the summer, it's like a spring in France. You won't be "too hot" like you sometimes are here, but you shouldn't be too cold either. The temperatures usually are between 10°C and 25°C.

=== The Snow 

If you're going to Finland in winter, I sure hope you like snow!

In Helsinki there's way less snow than in the inner lands, and I'm not even talking about the North. This is, obviously, mainly due to the Gulf Stream, especially as Helsinki is a harbor. The capital city is still usually covered in snow between December and the end of March. You can sometimes even see snow falls in May or something.

Finland being used to the snow, there shouldn't be too much problems with public transports because of that. There will still be black ice though, so stay careful when on foot or in your own car.
 
=== The Sun

The... what? +
I'm kidding, there's lots of that in summer!

Only 1/4 of the Finnish teritory is above the arctic circle, and thus knows total night for 6 months, and non-stop daylight for the rest of the year. +
But in Helsinki, you still have very short days in winter, and very long ones in summer.

At the end of December, the days last from... 11am to 2pm ? About so ? And even when the sun is "up", it's actually really low, like a sunrise. And when you think the day is really gonna start, the sunrise fades into sunset. And night. And it's not even 3pm. The real risks are the lazy mornings : you think it's very early because it's night ? Nope, it's almost noon !

During the summer, it's the same thing but upside down. At the end of June, night lasts from... midnight to 3am ? It's nice when you're leaving a bar and there's still some daylight, but blinds are mandatory if you want to get some sleep !

I personally really like those weird day times, but it can really annoy some people.+
Also, the very short days in winter tend to encourage depression, so take care of yourself and be careful about that!

=== Les Vêtements

Si vous avez des fringues de ski, c'est le moment de les sortir !

Pour le haut je vous conseille donc une bonne veste de ski, un gros pull, un ou plusieurs tee shirts selon votre degré de frilosité, et un bonnet, des gants (voire des sous-gants) et une grosse écharpe.

Pour le bas, les jours sans trop de neige les finlandais portent généralement des collants, avec un jean par dessus, et éventuellement une sorte de pantalon coupe-vent qui ressemble à un survet encore au dessus. Pour les jours de neige je vous conseille le bon vieux pantalon de ski !

Au niveau des pieds, ils portent des chaussettes normales + de grosses chaussettes de laine (qu'ils portent également chez eux à la place de chaussons d'ailleurs). Sinon ils portent n'importe quel type de chaussures tant qu'elles ne glissent pas trop, et des bottes quand il neige vraiment trop. Pour les filles, oubliez les talons !
